# 🧥 Aimé Leon Dore Website Clone

This is a **custom frontend clone** of the official [Aimé Leon Dore](https://www.aimeleondore.com) website.  
I’m rebuilding it from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no templates, no frameworks, no help. Just code, style, and vibes.

## 🎯 What I'm Building

- A pixel-accurate homepage with clean layout and smooth responsiveness  
- The **shipping location popup** you see when landing on the real site  
- Bold **typography, layout, and hover effects** to match the brand  
- Full **navigation bar**, featured product section, and editorial-style design  
- A true streetwear web experience cloned by hand

## 💻 Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🛠️ Why This Project

I’m recreating real-world fashion brand websites to:
